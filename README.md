# screenie

Silly, maybe useful, GPT Vision watching your screen and narrating

## How it works

Screenie takes a screenshot every second and sends it to OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model for analysis. The model then generates a description of the screenshot, which is printed to the terminal (in iTerm2 and hterm). After it's spoken out loud using a text-to-speech service.

## Installation

After cloning the repository, use `poetry` to install the project:

```
poetry install
```
